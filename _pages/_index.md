# Welcome to ML Gloss

This is a work in progress project that will aim to serve as learning platform for machine learning topics. I will be covering basic machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupvervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. In the beginning, I will introduce core concepts in each of those topics, such as classification/regression, k-means, and Q-learning. When the site has reached a state where I am happy with the basics, I will also cover recent topics from research, such as large language models, offline (batch) reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems.

Stay tuned! The repository is located at my [GitHub](https://github.com/timtody/ml-implementations).
